        <p>What is a Dolphin? 
            Dolphins can be defined as any various small marine toothed whale (family Delphinidae) with the snout more or less elongated into a beak and the neck vertebrae partially fused. (Not to be confused with porpoises who share similar features but have key differences.) </p>
        
        <h2>Types of Dolphins</h2>
        <p>There are currently 42 known species of dolphins (along with 7 porpoise species but we will not be addressing those.) The biggest dolphin family is the orca (killer whale) and the smallest known dolphin species are the New Zealand Dolphins, Tucuxi and Vaquitas. The most common dolphins are known as Short Beaked Common Dolphins.</p>
        
        <h2>Short Beaked Common Dolphin</h2>
        <p>Short-beaked common dolphins are one of the most abundant and familiar dolphins in the world. This species is widely distributed, preferring warm tropical to cool temperate waters that are primarily offshore.</p>
