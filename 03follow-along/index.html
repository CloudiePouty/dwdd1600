        <h1>Who is this cute penguin?</h1>
        <p><a href="Bowties.html#sign">Tuxedosam</a> was born on <strong>May 12th</strong> at the South Pole, where he learned to speak "Penguinese", although he also speaks fluent English. He likes to eat all the time. He is a little na√Øve and open to making careless mistakes, however, lots of people love him. Tuxedosam boasts a collection of 365 bow ties.</p>
        <p>Initially in 1979, <em>Tuxedo Sam was created to be Hello Kitty's boyfriend,</em> but later on, he was replaced by Dear Daniel.</p>
